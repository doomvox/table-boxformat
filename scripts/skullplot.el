;; Description:
;; A typical database shell (e.g. psql, mysql) displays the
;; results of queries in a tabular text format I call the box format
;; or "dbox" (file extension: *.dbox).

;; The skullplot.el package exists to assist in generating graphical
;; plots of SQL query results in this "dbox" form form (by the way:
;; database purists dislike pronouncing SQL as 'sequel', an obvious
;; alternative is 'skull').  It works with a perl script skullplot.pl
;; and a perl module Data::BoxFormat, and the R statistical language package
;; ggplot2.

;; (( TODO: every piece should check that all the other pieces are installed. ))

;;  The main user function here is:
;;   skullplot-of-this-dbox

;; Installation:

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'skullplot)

;; TODO key assignment for skullplot-of-this-dbox in various shells and db interfaces...

;;; Code:

(provide 'skullplot)
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl))

Note: converts relative paths to absolute, using the current
default-directory setting, unless specified otherwise with the
ROOT option, this has the side-effect of converting the empty
string into the default-directory or the ROOT setting."
